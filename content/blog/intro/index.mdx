## A new beginning

First of all, unfortunately this is not a story of how i learned coding in 3 months, or how to master 10 languages in a week.
This is a story of a long path which i believe and hope will get longer and longer in time.
I started out with some HTML, CSS move to JavaScript from there. After I've gotten comfortable with the basics,
it was time to conquer frameworks and libraries. I started with React for the front-end,
Expressjs and Nodejs for the back-end, MongoDB for database. Also enjoyed
